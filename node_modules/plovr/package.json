As new versions of Plovr are released\nand vetted, this module will be updated accordingly.\n\nRunning\n-------\n\n```shell\nbin/plovr [plovr arguments]\n```\n\nAnd npm will install a link to the binary in `node_modules/.bin` as\nit is wont to do.\n\nNote that Plovr requires a Java runtime to operate. It specifically\nassumes that there is a binary called `java` in the `$PATH` and will\nundoubtedly fail spectacularly if that's not the case.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nQuestions, comments, bug reports, and pull requests are all welcome.\nSubmit them at [the project on GitHub](https://github.com/Obvious/plovr/).\n\nBug reports that include steps-to-reproduce (including code) are the\nbest. Even better, make them in the form of pull requests.\n\nAuthor\n------\n\n[Dan Bornstein](https://github.com/danfuzz)\n([personal website](http://www.milk.com/)), supported by\n[The Obvious Corporation](http://obvious.com/).\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright 2012 [The Obvious Corporation](http://obvious.com/).\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. \nSee the top-level file `LICENSE.txt` and\n(http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n",
