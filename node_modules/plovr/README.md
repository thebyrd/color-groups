plovr
=====

An npm wrapper for [Plovr](http://plovr.com/), the Closure (JS compiler) build tool.

Building and Installing
-----------------------

```shell
npm install plovr
```

Or grab the source and

```shell
node ./install.js
```

What this is really doing is just grabbing a particular "blessed" (by
this module) version of Plovr. As new versions of Plovr are released
and vetted, this module will be updated accordingly.

Running
-------

```shell
bin/plovr [plovr arguments]
```

And npm will install a link to the binary in `node_modules/.bin` as
it is wont to do.

Note that Plovr requires a Java runtime to operate. It specifically
assumes that there is a binary called `java` in the `$PATH` and will
undoubtedly fail spectacularly if that's not the case.

Contributing
------------

Questions, comments, bug reports, and pull requests are all welcome.
Submit them at [the project on GitHub](https://github.com/Obvious/plovr/).

Bug reports that include steps-to-reproduce (including code) are the
best. Even better, make them in the form of pull requests.
